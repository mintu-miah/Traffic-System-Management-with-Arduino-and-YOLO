# Traffic-System-Management-with-Arduino-and-YOLO
Efficient traffic management is crucial for reducing congestion and enhancing safety in urban environments. Traditional traffic signal systems, which often rely on preset timings, fail to adapt to real-time traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies and increased wait times. This project introduces an intelligent traffic management system that employs the YOLO V8 deep learning model for real-time vehicle detection, integrated with an Arduino UNO microcontroller for signal control. The system dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on the continuous analysis of vehicle flow at intersections, aiming to optimize traffic throughput and reduce congestion. The YOLO V8 model was trained on a diverse dataset of vehicle images to ensure robust detection under various environmental conditions. The Arduino UNO was programmed to interpret the detection data and control the traffic lights accordingly, with a custom traffic rule algorithm developed to determine the optimal timing for each signal based on the detected vehicle count. Initial tests in simulated environments demonstrated the system's potential to significantly improve traffic flow and reduce vehicle idling time. This report details the system's design, development, and testing process, and discusses its implementation challenges, such as hardware limitations and environmental variability. Despite these challenges, the results indicate that integrating AI technologies into traffic management can substantially enhance urban transportation systems, paving the way for future smart city initiatives.
